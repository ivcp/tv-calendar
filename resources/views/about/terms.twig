    <h2>1. About {{ app_name }}</h2>
    <p>
      {{ app_name }} is a website that helps users track their favorite TV
      shows, see upcoming episodes on a calendar, and discover series. You may
      use the Service with or without an account. If you create an account, your
      show list and related data will be stored on our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

      You must be at least 16 years old to use the Service, or have permission
      from a parent or legal guardian if younger.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Accounts and Authentication</h2>
    <p>
      You may create an account using Google Sign-In or a username and password.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure and for any
      activity performed under your account. If you believe your account has
      been compromised, contact us immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree <strong>not</strong> to:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
      <li>Use the Service for unlawful purposes</li>
      <li>Attempt to access accounts or data belonging to others</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Website or its infrastructure</li>
      <li>Abuse, scrape, or overload our servers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</p>

    <h2>5. Content and Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      {{ app_name }} does not host videos or episodes. We only display
      scheduling information and metadata for informational purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our website uses TV data provided by the
      <a href="https://www.tvmaze.com">TVmaze API</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All trademarks, show names, and images belong to their respective owners.
      The Website’s code, layout, features, and design belong to the Service
      owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not copy, distribute, or reuse significant parts of the Website
      without permission.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
    <p>
      Your use of the Service is also governed by our
      <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, which explains what data we collect, how
      we use it, and how your rights under GDPR are protected.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Website uses third-party providers such as Google (for optional
      login), Cloudflare Web Analytics, and hosting/infrastructure providers.
      These providers may process limited personal data as described in the
      Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not responsible for the content, practices, or availability of
      external websites or services.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Availability and Changes</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee
      uninterrupted uptime, permanent data storage, or complete accuracy of TV
      scheduling data.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may update, change, or discontinue any part of the Service at any time
      without notice.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Data Storage and Backups</h2>
    <p>
      Show lists saved without an account are stored locally in your browser and
      may be lost if you clear your browser's local storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accounts created with Google or username/password store data in our
      database. We make reasonable efforts to keep your data safe, but we cannot
      guarantee against all possible loss or unauthorized access.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users who use the Service without creating an account may store up to 10
      shows in their browser’s local storage. Creating an account removes this
      limit and stores your show list securely on our servers. During account
      creation any existing show list will be automatically backed up in our
      database.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, {{ app_name }} and its owner are
      not liable for lost data, inaccurate scheduling information, outages,
      downtime, or any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising
      from your use of the Service.
    </p>
    <p>Your use of the Website is at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time, with or
      without reason, including for violations of these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may delete your account at any time. Account deletion removes your
      stored data from our database.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of the country where the data
      controller of {{ app_name }} is located, unless local laws require
      otherwise.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms occasionally. When changes are significant, we
      will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your
      continued use of the Service after updates means you accept the revised
      Terms.
    </p>
