To clear his younger twin brother's charge, the team leader of the criminal investigation department Guan Hong Feng wants to take on this case, but since he's a relative, he's not allowed to participate in the investigation. A new team leader named Zhou Xun is assigned and ends up seeking Hong Feng's help. Zhou Xun and Hong Feng as his \"consultant\" uncover a number of cases together. However, Hong Feng has a secret: one of the twin brothers has fear of the dark phobia, so the \"Hong Feng\" appearing at the police station during the day and at night is actually not the same person. Together, the twins secretely try to find out the truth about the \"family extinction murder case\".</p>",

    "summary": "<p>It started as a beautiful summer morning, warm and sunny, but ended as one of the darkest days in Australia's history. December 15, 2014, is indelibly seared into the nation's psyche as the moment when terrorism came to the heart of Sydney.</p><p><br />Ten years on, this Sunday, Peter Overton presents a powerful special edition of <i>60 MINUTES</i>, remembering the 17 hours of terror at the Lindt Café siege.<br /><br />At 8.33am on that horrific day, lone-wolf gunman Man Haron Monis, claiming allegiance to Islamic State, walked into the popular café and shortly thereafter took 18 innocent people hostage. Threatening not only to shoot his captives, but also to detonate bombs he'd planted around the city, Monis wreaked havoc until 2.13am the following morning.<br /><br />When the ordeal was over, not only was the terrorist dead – tragically, so were two hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson.<br /><br />Through the recollections of survivors inside the café, as well as the perspectives of police and political leaders charged with ending the siege, this program is a showcase of the bravery of the men and women whose lives continue to be affected by that awful day.<br /><br />It is also a tribute to the memories of the victims and a timely reminder to heed the painful lessons learnt from the tragedy to ensure such a crime never happens again in Australia.</p>",

        "summary": "<p>\"Brocade Odyssey\" tells a courageous and determined tale of overcoming challenges. It follows the legendary journey of Ji Yingying, a fiery and spirited woman from Shu, as she grows from a young girl at a dyehouse into a master craftswoman. During the Tang Dynasty, the beauty of Shu brocade was renowned worldwide. Nobles and the rich coveted it, and the military even used brocade as a form of payment. Under the thriving brocade industry in Yizhou, unseen tensions developed beneath the surface. The Ji family's Shu Red Silk, renowned for its unparalleled quality, was so highly sought after that it earned the saying, \"Shu Red outshines all reds.\" Yet, this very reputation led to tragedy. The Ji family became caught in a fake brocade scandal, resulting in the unjust death of Ji Yingying's father and the family's overnight downfall. From a young age, Ji Yingying demonstrated intelligence and a passion for dyeing silk. Her natural talent grew, and she vowed to restore the glory of the Ji family's brocade business and clear her father's name. However, her journey was filled with obstacles, particularly from Zhao Xiuyuan, the son of the prominent Zhao family, whose unrequited love for her turned into hostility. Yang Jinglan, the illegitimate son of the prestigious Brocade Master family, returned to Yizhou after years of study abroad. Despite his reputation as a frivolous and short-lived official, he patiently navigated through court and society to uncover the truth behind the long-buried mystery. His path crossed with Ji Yingying, the spirited girl who had left an indelible impression on him during childhood. Together, they tackled crises and challenges that threaten the brocade industry. Ji Yingying's innovative dyeing techniques earned her fame across Shu, drawing the attention of Sheng Fengze, the king of Nanzhao State, who had long coveted the secrets of various brocade houses. As Nanzhao's aggressive tactics put Yizhou in peril, Ji Yingying took risks to protect her fellow artisans. Meanwhile, Yang Jinglan ventured into Nanzhao, joining forces with Ji Yingying to negotiate and safeguard the brocade trade. Their collaboration revived the brocade industry and left behind a timeless tale of Shu brocade's legacy.</p>",

At the crime scene she unexpectedly meets Tomáš and soon afterwards she gets in contact with a demon who enters inside her but she doesn't become possessed by him which never happened before. Tomáš believes that this is a new chance and that Alice can become a new weapon in an unequal battle.

The huge disparity between reality and ideals does not stop him from pursuing his dreams. By chance, Qin Chuan subdues a criminal planning to cause an explosion with his bare hands, which kickstarts his career as a criminal investigator. Under the leadership of his superiors, he gradually matures and successively solves several major earth-shattering cases. When his buddy Ye Maosheng sacrifices himself heroically in a police chase, Qin Chuan becomes more aware of the responsibility that the police shoulder. Under the guidance and encouragement of his senior criminal investigators, Qin Chuan actively participates in police reform and team building from a higher perspective. He leads the team to resolve multiple long-standing cases and establishes a specialized criminal system and three-in-one information platform, creating a modern and professional criminal investigation team, and realizing his dream of becoming an excellent Chinese criminal investigator.</p>",

He meets the Mo Sect orphan Gan Po (played by Zheng Hehuizi) who came to seek revenge, as well as Wang Yishao (played by Zhu Zanjin), Han Aizhen (played by Wang Zijia), Gao Yin (played by Moe Jiang), Hu Jiao (played by Yin Qixi), and others with various identities and motives. As Qing Cai lands himself in ridiculously comical situations as he tries to hide his identity, he also develops feelings for Gan Pu. The two bickering friends Qing Cai and Gan Pu gradually fall in love with each other, but in the face of their true identities, they drift apart. When Gan Pu finally works out her conflicted feelings, she joins hands with Qing Cai to fight against the enemy.</p>",

        "summary": "<p><b>Fox NFL Sunday</b> is an American sports-talk television program on Fox that debuted on September 4, 1994, and serves as the pre-game show for the network's National Football League game telecasts under the <i>NFL on Fox</i> brand. An audio simulcast of the program airs on sister radio network Fox Sports Radio, which is distributed by Premiere Radio Networks. As of 2014, the program has won four Emmy Awards. <i>Fox NFL Sunday</i> debuted on September 4, 1994, when Fox inaugurated its NFL game broadcasts through the network's recently acquired broadcast rights to the National Football Conference; it was originally hosted by James Brown, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long and Jimmy Johnson (both Brown and Bradshaw had joined the network from CBS to help helm Fox's NFL coverage). The program was notable in being the first hour-long NFL pregame show on a broadcast television network; network pregame programs that existed beforehand, such as CBS' <i>The NFL Today</i> or NBC's <i>NFL Live!</i>, aired as 30-minute broadcasts. Fox's show also adopted a looser, more irreverent approach than its predecessors in order to also appeal to the network's younger-skewing audiences. During Johnson's initial season on <i>Fox NFL Sunday</i>, he would often join the show from his home in Florida. There was much speculation that Jimmy Johnson would return to coaching during the first year of the program's run. Prior to the end of the year, Johnson made an \"announcement,\" saying he was happy with his new career in broadcasting. But in 1996, he left the program to become head coach of the Miami Dolphins; Ronnie Lott was brought in to succeed him, and stayed with the program for two seasons.</p>",

As of March 2013, 865 episodes in total have been produced.</p><p>Tatort is currently being broadcast in the United States on the MHz Worldview channel under the name Scene of the Crime.</p>",

Henry and Jane are expecting a child, and for the third time in his life, the king allows himself to imagine a legitimate heir. The war in the north is over, the rebels are stilled, and the Lady Mary is back at court and out of reach of Henry's enemies. England is cautiously hopeful. But joy at the birth of the young prince in the autumn of 1538 is short-lived, for Edward is only 12 days old when his mother Jane dies in the complications of childbirth, and Henry's court is plunged into mourning.</p>",

        "summary": "<p>Who are these women and what drives them to kill? Oxygen's hit true crime series, <b>Snapped</b>, profiles fascinating cases of women accused of murder. Did they really do it? And if they did, why? Whether the motivation is revenge against a cheating husband, the promise of a hefty insurance payoff, or putting an end to years of abuse, the reasons are as varied as the women themselves. From socialites to secretaries, female killers share one thing in common: at some point, they all snapped. Each episode of <i>Snapped</i> chronicles the life of a woman who has been charged with murder. These shocking but true stories turn common assumptions about crime and criminals upside down, and prove that even the most unlikely suspects can be capable of murder.</p>",

The program is generally aired on Fox, CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates (along with a few affiliates of other major networks), though a majority of the stations that carry the series are Fox affiliates. It is essentially a television version of its sister operation, TMZ.com, a news website with a heavy emphasis on gossip of celebrities' personal lives, which debuted in December 2005. The television program is produced at studio facilities that serve as the headquarters for the parent website, located at 13031 West Jefferson Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. TMZ is an insider term (\"thirty-mile zone\" or studio zone), referring to the movie studio area of downtown Hollywood. On October 23, 2013, Warner Bros. Television Distribution announced that the program's charter station group, FOX Television Stations, renewed <i>TMZ on TV</i> through the 2016–17 season.</p>",

        "summary": "<p><b>Beyond the Gates </b>is set in a leafy Maryland suburb just outside of Washington D.C., and in one the most affluent African American counties in the United States. Here you'll find a posh gated community with winding tree-lined streets and luxurious mansions to call home. At the center of this community are the Duprees, a powerful and prestigious multi-generational family that is the very definition of Black royalty. But behind these pristine walls and lush, manicured gardens are juicy secrets and scandals waiting to be uncovered. And those that live outside these gates are watching closely. These are the places where our characters live, love, work and play. Those who have \"made it\" and those who haven't are all trying to navigate life … and some with more grace than others.</p>",
